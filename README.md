_Example integration of another javascript project into xTuple._

A common use case for xTuple extensions is the integration of substantive third-party
projects into the xTuple app. The xTuple extension system allows you to bring in these
projects in whatever manner you choose.

The point of this extension is to show two very simple use cases. 

- A standalone html page is injected into the app using an iframe
- A javascript library is imported, and the xTuple app hands over a div to that other library

This particular example is not going to win any design awards! It's meant as a starter template
for you to build your own work. Happy xTupling!
